## Libraries

The Mumble Link script requires a few jar files which will be downloaded on runtime. They are only hosted here on this github so that there is a constant direct download for running the script. You can find these in .minecraft/LiquidBounce/Mumble. The sources for these jars can be downloaded here:

[java-mumble-link-0.2.6.jar](https://github.com/magneticflux-/java-mumble-link)
